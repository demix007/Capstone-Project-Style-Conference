# HTML/CSS & JavaScript capstone project - Conference Page

> This project is a final capstone project for HTML/CSS & JavaScript. In order to meet the project requirements, I had to implement the following: 
- Set up the Linters and ensured that there are no linter errors. 
- Used the correct GitHub flow.
- Used the recommended design guidelines including colors, typography, and layout.
- Built the first two pages: The home page and the about page.
- Ensured that each page has versions for 2 different sizes: the mobile (up to 768px wide) and the desktop(768px or wider) versions.
- Created interactions on the site (Links and mobile menu).
- Created the section "Featured Speakers" dynamically in JavaScript.    

## Built With

- HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT.
